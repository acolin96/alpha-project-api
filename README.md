## Decription
Our Application uses The Harvard Art Directory which allows users to randomly generate art images and objects. Once an image or object is selected, the user is provided information about the selection; for example, the Title, Artist Name, Date of Creation, and Culture pertaining to the piece. Wikipedia links are also provided for a more in depth look if the user desires. Users are also able to archive favorites into local storage by clicking the heart icon under each selection. Our hope is the application can provide a medium for users to.   Our application is for those who love art, create art, and are inspired by art.
